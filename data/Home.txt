Welcome to the official web page of pSESYNTH, a visionary multi-year endeavor dedicated to bridging the past with the present for a more sustainable future. Our project, titled "The Whole is Not the Sum of the Parts: Building a Synthesis Database of Past Human-Environmental Systems in the Global South (pSESYNTH)," is committed to fostering international collaboration and advancing paleo-scientific research in the Global South.

At the heart of pSESYNTH lies a profound objective - to establish, articulate, and fortify regional, interdisciplinary teams focused on unraveling the mysteries of past socio-environmental systems in the Global South. Our guiding star is the creation of the first-ever multi-disciplinary paleo-database, designed to represent and preserve the invaluable heritage of this diverse and dynamic region.

Join us in this journey to uncover the secrets of the past and to build a more sustainable and informed future. Together, we can make history accessible, and our actions today, resonate in the landscapes of tomorrow.

pSESYNTH is funded by the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA), the multi-year and inderdisciplinary database project
