                <p>Welcome to the official web page of pSESYNTH, a visionary multi-year endeavor dedicated to bridging the past with the present for a more sustainable future. Our project, titled "The Whole is Not the Sum of the Parts: Building a Synthesis Database of Past Human-Environmental Systems in the Global South (pSESYNTH)," is committed to fostering international collaboration and advancing paleo-scientific research in the Global South.</p>
<p>At the heart of pSESYNTH lies a profound objective - to establish, articulate, and fortify regional, interdisciplinary teams focused on unraveling the mysteries of past socio-environmental systems in the Global South. Our guiding star is the creation of the first-ever multi-disciplinary paleo-database, designed to represent and preserve the invaluable heritage of this diverse and dynamic region.</p>
<p>Join us in this journey to uncover the secrets of the past and to build a more sustainable and informed future. Together, we can make history accessible, and our actions today, resonate in the landscapes of tomorrow.</p>
<p>pSESYNTH is funded by the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA), the multi-year and inderdisciplinary database project</p>
